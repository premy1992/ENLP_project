1.3  Its a location in memory that contains the memory address of another location in memory that contains information. 
1.3  A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address as its value. 
1.3  A pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable. 
1.3  Pointers are variables that contain as their values memory addresses of other variables. 
1.3  A data type whose value refers to another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address. 
1.3  a pointer holds a memory location 
1.3  a name that represents actual location or value of a data type. int star of bPtr points to an integer value. 
1.3  A variable that stores the address of another variable 
1.3  a pointer is a programming language data type whose value refers directly to -LRB- or points to -RRB- another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address 
1.3  A data type whose value refers to another value stored somewhere else in the computer memory using its address. 
1.3  It is like a variable however instead of holding data, it holds a location in memory. 
1.3  A pointer is a reference to a location in memory 
1.3  A pointer is a reference to the memory location of an object. 
1.3  A pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of a variable that has a value. 
1.3  It is a variable that contains not only a star of value but has a memory address associated with it, and can be moved along a string or an array by jumping up one memory address. 
1.3  Contains a variable 's memory address as a value. 
1.3  variable that points to the memory address of another variable and it is type specific. 
1.3  An element that references a memory cell 
1.3  Is a reference call to the place in memory where the object is stored. 
1.3  a variable that contains the address of another variable 
1.3 A pointer variable contains the number of a memory address as its value, which may be null or 0, or the address of some value stored in memory. 
1.3  A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address of anther variable 
1.3  A variable that contains the memory address of another variable that contains a specific value. 
1.3  a variable with a memory address as the value 
1.3  it is a type that points to something else.  It is the memory address of something else 
1.3  A pointer is a way to get at another object.  Essentially it is a way to grab an instance of an object and then either pass that instance a message or retreive some data from that object.  A pointer is actually just an address of where an instance is held in memory.
